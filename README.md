#WDI: First Project

###Workflow & Submission
Full project requirements and instructions are [here](https://github.com/sf-wdi-18/notes/blob/master/projects/project_1.md)! **Read that entire document before writing a line of code.**
This file is where you will document your project.  

My primary goal for this project was to really focus on the OOP part redesigning my tic-tac-toe game. I tried to make my code modular and seperate events and methods onto their respective prototypes in a way which made sense and allowed for a strong setup to scale and modify. Primarily, I seperated the 'board' from the 'game' object when using methods, and tried to utilize state setting instead of incrementing counter logic. This ended up taking longer then I initially anticipated, and though I am happy with what I accomplished- I would like to add more features to the game. 

### Technologies Used
For this project my main tools were jQuery, JS, HTML, and CSS

###Existing features
Compared to my last version, this tic-tac-toe includes a running scoreboard, multiple game feature, and turn tracker. Also includes css animations.

###Planned features
For the future I would like to add:
A undo/redo feature
Overlays to accompany game events (win, lose, draw, etc.)
